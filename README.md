# SQL-HW
 Module 9 HW
 This homework wasn't too bad. Simple SQL stuff but it was very helpful understanding the concepts of joins and groupbys. I really took advantage of the create views and basically used them as like junction table for certain scenarios instead of really going in depth with subqueries. Plus those were really fun. Understood everything decently well. Not sure if I got all the primary and foreign keys tho right.
